                            The first design was to hold the pi in hand.
                            We added a gyroscope to help straighten images and worked on a proximity sensor to activate the model when a flat surface was detected
                            however, those devices added too much bulk
                            Finally, we landed on a device with a camera, battery, raspberry pi, and speaker
                            all mounted on a paint stick

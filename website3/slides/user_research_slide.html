                        <p align="justify">Our team has partnered with two organizations: “Lighthouse for the blind” based in San Francisco and “East Bay center for the blind” at Berkeley.
                            We conducted various stakeholder interviews to determine product requirements.
                            The requirements can be summed up in 4 points:
                            <ul align="justify">
                                <li>The product should be easy to use with no or minimal user training.
                                <li>Considering that over 70% of blind people in US are unemployed, the product cost was constrained to sub $100 range.
                                <li>The cost constrained meant the final product should not be based on a smart phones.
                                <li>The solution should work with limited or no internet connectivity.
                            </ul>
                            <p align ="justify">
                            Based on these requirements and our stakeholder interviews,
                                we decided to develop a minimum viable product that
                                focuses on a specific Microwave. We decided to develop
                                Appliance sight based on raspberry pi, pi camera and an
                                onboard AI/ML model to classify the digits and text on
                                the keypad and an onboard speaker to provide feedback to user.
